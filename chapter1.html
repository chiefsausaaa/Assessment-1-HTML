<h2>Method</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Crack eggs into a bowl, add herbs, and season lightly with salt and pepper. Using wooden chopsticks, beat until well blended and ingredients are incorporated. .</li>

    <li>Heat an 8-inch nonstick or seasoned carbon steel pan over high. Add butter, and cook until foamy but not browned, tipping pan to coat bottom evenly with melted butter.</li>

    <li>Pour eggs into pan; immediately swirl pan clockwise while stirring eggs vigorously counterclockwise with chopsticks to keep curds small and creamy.</li>

    <li>When a soft scramble forms, stop stirring eggs. Drag chopsticks around outside edge of omelet to turn wispy edges into scrambled eggs.</li>

    <li>Once a thin sheet of cooked egg (egg crêpe) forms on surface of pan, quickly sprinkle with cheese, if desired.</li>

    <li>Using an underhanded grip on handle, tilt pan away and begin rolling egg crêpe filled with soft scrambled eggs toward edge of pan opposite the handle. Using chopsticks, tuck edge into omelet. Turn out omelet onto plate, seam side down.</li>
